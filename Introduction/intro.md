## SPRING BOOT OVERVIEW

Spring Boot helps you to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications that you can run. 

- Why Spring Boot
    - While working with Spring Framework, you might have noticed the following points:
        - Provide all the compatible libraries for the specific Spring version and configure them.
        - Majority of the time we configure the DataSource, EntityManagerFactory, TransactionManager, Spring MVC beans in the same way most of the times.
    - Spring boot automates that.
- Spring Boot is a framework on top of spring which ease the bootstrapping and development of new Spring application.
- Provide default code and annotation configuration to quick start.
- It buils protection grade application i.e. available for development ASAP.
- It follows "Opinionated Defaults Configuration" approach to avoid lot of boilerplate code and configuration to improve development.
- **ADVANTAGE:**
    - easy to integrate Spring Boot Application with its Spring Ecosystem like Spring JDBC, Sprin ORM, Spring Data, Spring Security etc.
    - Provides Embedded HTTP servers like Tomcat, Jetty etc to develop and test our web application very easily.
    - Provides plugins to develop and test apps very easily using build tools like Maven and Gradle.
- **DRAWBACKS:**
    - Converting existing Spring framework app into Spring Boot is time consuming.
